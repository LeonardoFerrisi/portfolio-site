BrainArt is a long running project from work I did during the completion of my Bachelor's Degree at Union College.

The project was initially designed as a hackathon concept with the talented group at [*Union Neurotech*](https://github.com/Union-Neurotech) - a student org I founded at Union College.

The Union Neurotech version of this project is available here: https://github.com/Union-Neurotech/BrainArt
