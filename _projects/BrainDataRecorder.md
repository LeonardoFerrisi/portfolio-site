BrainDataRecorder or BDR for short is a project of mine facilitated through [NRVS Labs](https://nrvs-labs.github.io/), a software community I co-founded.

BDR aims to solve the complexity required for getting data from biosensing hardware (i.e. EEG bioamplifiers). Typically companies provide specific proprietary software, however frameworks such as *brainflow* solve this issue by allowing one to connect to many different types of devices using one API. For the less software-adept, Brainflow can have a small learning curve. 

BDR utilizes Brainflow and ElectronJS together in a Graphical User Interface that simply, allows users to select their biosensing device and record data from it. 

**BDR is still a work in progress.**
